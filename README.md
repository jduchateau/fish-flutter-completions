Flutter completions for fish
============================

I use fish instead of big IDE when I work with flutter, so this is quite useful.

## Installation

Install with [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) :
```fish
fisher add jduchateau/fish-flutter-completions
```

Otherwise, you could copy the file in your fish directory (typically in `~/.config/fish/completions`).
